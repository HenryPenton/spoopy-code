# Problem 3 - A Cure

Having found many curious instances of people being seen after they pass, you realise some writing has appeared on the wall in blood. It reads:

_The answers you seek lie within the witch's tome.._

Searching around you find a witch's cookbook open on an elegant looking stand in the corner of the room. A recipe called _Elixir of Unbinding_ is visible on current page, and as you read the description...

_A rare and potent concoction, the Elixir of Unbinding is said to release the ties between the living and the restless spirits who wander familiar places. Brewed under the pale light of a waning moon, this potion requires ingredients gathered from the heart of mist-laden woods and waters touched by starlight. BEWARE: the ingredients must be added in the correct order, or the potionâ€™s effects may reverse, binding the curse ever tighter._

.. you decide this must be what one who came before you had to set out to complete.

Attached to the side of the book podium, you find a large ream of paper with sets of locations, potion ingredients and dates.

```javascript
  {
    "Potion Item": "Phoenix Ash",
    "Location Found": "The Forgotten Inn",
    "Date": "1802-01-13"
  }
```
You notice one of the entries on the first page is circled... circled with a date that looks familiar. Yes! This is a date of a sighting of one who had passed, and furthermore, __the location matches the sighting__..

Flicking through the rest of the ream, you see that your helpful unknown co-investigator never circled any more.

There's nothing else for it - with the witch's words about the strict creation rules of the potion ringing in your mind - you decide to find any other sightings of the dead to see if it gives you a list of ingredients.
