# Problem 1 - Unexpected Deaths

The village of Tymber lay in a sleepy hollow, with mostly friendly inhabitants. It's surrounded by many other settlements, and though day to day life didn't see much interaction between these different communities, they did come together for a few festivals each year.

## The problem

You find yourself in the old abandoned Tymber library, reading old scripts left lying around. Being the observant kind, you notice that something sinister seems to be up. The record of people attending certain festivals shows that they died whilst attending the festival, something that sounds most unlikely given the accounts of the festival activities you've found...

Work out which of the villagers passed away during a festival.
