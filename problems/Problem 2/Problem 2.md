# Problem 2 - Hauntings

Once you work out who passed, a book you'd not previously noticed starts glowing on a shelf. Picking up the heavy tome, you see that it is a log book of sightings of the different villagers. Having seen slightly suspicious deaths of some of the villagers, you start to look them up in the log book and find something most unsettling. One of the sightings of the deceased is after their death...

You decide to parse the log book to find any other similar occurrences.
